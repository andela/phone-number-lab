##Phone Number

The rules are as follows:

- If the phone number is less than 10 digits assume that it is bad
  number
- If the phone number is 10 digits assume that it is good
- If the phone number is more than 11 digits assume that it is a bad
  number

We've provided tests, now make them pass.

Hint: Only make one test pass at a time. Disable the others, then flip
each on in turn after you get the current failing one to pass.


### How to Run this Lab

+ Clone the repository
+ Open **index.html** in your browser to see the currently failing test specs you are to pass
+ Open the repository in your favorite text editor to explore the different files
+ Open **js\phone-number.js** and write the function(s) or lines of code to pass the tests
+ You could refresh **index.html** in your browser intermittently to see the status of test specs.


###Notes

+ Prior understanding of Javascript classes, returning, and conditional statements will be required to complete this exercise.

+ Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

+ Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the specification.

Have fun!
